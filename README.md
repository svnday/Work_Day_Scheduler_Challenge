This project is a task manager for an 8-hour workday! Its functionality allows you to type tasks in to their respective time blocks in 1-hour increments from 9am to 5pm. The time blocks will change colors to indicate past, present, and future for immediate view of your workday. The application will also save your tasks so that you can return to them even if you close your browser for the day.
